This stackoverflow seems interesting because it might allow me 
to add the script to the HTML, programatically. This way
I might be able to hide the API key like in the other project.

Was able to add the API link into the HTML with the solution found in the link mentioned above. This way I can have the project on GitHub without exposing the API key.

Had to place the Autocomplete code inside the $( window ).on( "load", function() for the "google" keyword to be recognized.
